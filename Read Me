Find the Sum of the Numbers in a Given Interval in Java
Given the range as integer input, the objective is to find the Sum of all the Numbers that lay in the given interval using different methods. To do so we basically iterate from the base interval to the final interval and keep adding the number. Here are some of the methods to solve the above mentioned problem in Java Language.

Method 1: Using Brute Force
Method 2: Using the Formula
Method 3: Using Recursion
We’ll discuss the above mentioned methods in detail in the upcoming sections.

Method 1: Using Brute Force
In this method we’ll use loops to iterate through from the base interval to the upper interval meanwhile adding all the numbers to the sum variable.

Working
For the given integer input intervals number1 and number2

Initialize the required variables.
Initiate a for loop from range [5,10].
Keep adding the value of the iter variable to sum variable.
Print the sum variable.
Let’s implement the above working in Java Language.

Method 2: Using the Formula
In this method we’ll use a sequence and series formula to find the sum of n numbers in a series. Formula : N*(N+1)/2.

Working
For the given integer input intervals number1 and number2

Initialize the required variables.
Apply the given formula sum = b*(b+1)/2 – a*(a+1)/2 + a.
Print the sum variable as output.
Let’s implement the above working in Java Language.

Method 3: Using Recursion
In this method we’ll use recursion to iterate through and sum up all the numbers that lay in the given interval.

Working
For the Integer inputs number1 and number2

Initialize the required variable sum = 0.
Define a recursive function with base case as number1 == number2.
Set the recursive set call as num1+ function(sum,num1+1,num2).
print the returned value after calling the recursive functions.
Let’s implement the working in Java Language.
